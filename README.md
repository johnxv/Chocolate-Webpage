# Chocolate-Webpage
Second time practicing my html5 and css3 coding skills.

Language: HTML5, CSS3
Challenges: Getting the logic of how div tags work and the animations such as transitions

It's a simple webpage that I wanted to glamour up. Using div tags to separate each component and design them individually.
